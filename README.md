# NoStudyBro - Motivational Break Website
```Live Demo```
NoStudyBro is a simple, one-page website designed to motivate students (and anyone working hard) to take a break from their studies and relax. Every time you visit the site, a new motivational quote and image are displayed, and the background color changes, giving you a fresh experience to help reset your mind and reduce burnout.

###Features
-	Dynamic Quotes: A new motivational quote is shown every time the page is refreshed.
-	Rotating Images: Along with the quotes, the website also displays a new image each time, providing visual encouragement to take a break.
-	Color Change: The background color changes dynamically with each visit, adding an extra layer of variety to keep the experience refreshing.
-	Minimalist Design: The website is clean and simple, with a focus on quick motivation without distractions.
-	Responsive Layout: Works across different screen sizes, ensuring users can access it from both mobile and desktop devices.

### Technologies Used
•	HTML: For the basic structure of the webpage.
•	CSS: For styling the layout, colors, and positioning of elements.
•	JavaScript: To handle the dynamic content (changing quotes, images, and colors).

###How It Works
•	Quotes & Images: The website has a pre-set list of motivational quotes and corresponding images. Each time the page is loaded, one is randomly selected and displayed.
•	Color Change: A random color is generated and applied to the background with every refresh to create a new visual experience each time.
